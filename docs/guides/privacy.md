# Privacy and Data Collection

These days, it feels like every piece of software is tracking you. From your
browser, to your phone, to your terminal, programs collect as much data about
you as possible and send it off to the cloud for analysis.

We believe the best way to keep data safe is to never collect it in the first
place.

## Our Privacy Pledge

The `sqlc` program does not collect any information. It does not send crash
reports to a third-party. It does not gather anonymous aggregate user behaviour
analytics.

No analytics. 
No finger-printing.
No tracking.

Not now and not in the future.

## Distribution Channels

We distribute sqlc using popular package managers such as
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/). These
package managers and their associated command-line tools do collect usage
metrics.

We use these services to make it easy to for users to install sqlc. There will
always be an option to download sqlc from a stable URL.
