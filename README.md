# ðŸš¨ NOT PRODUCTION READY ðŸš¨

DinoSQL is **very new** and in no way production ready. So far it's been tested
in only three (!!) small applications. The interface and command line tool are
under heavy developement and **will change**. The documentation below isn't
even correct!

## DinoSQL

> SQL is actually pretty great

DinoSQL is inspired by [PugSQL](https://pugsql.org/) and [HugSQL](https://www.hugsql.org/).

### Usage

```
$ dinosql -h
DinoSQL is a tool for generating Go source code from SQL.

Usage:

  dinosql <command> [arguments]

The commands are:

  check       verify SQL
  fmt         format SQL
  gen         generate Go files by processing SQL
```
